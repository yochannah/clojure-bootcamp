1. [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/#install)
2. A way to edit the code we'll be writing. This could be:
    1. [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) with the [Cursive plugin](https://cursive-ide.com/) (free for open source projects) (Josh's preference)
    2. Atom Editor with [lisp-paredit](https://atom.io/packages/lisp-paredit) and [optional extra plugins](https://gist.github.com/jasongilman/d1f70507bed021b48625).
    3. [LightTable](http://lighttable.com/)

That's it! Atom is less strict and offers less support for code completion than Intellij.
