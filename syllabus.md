 1. Downloading and running a clojure project
 2. Hiccup (clojure's version of HTML)
 3. Writing a function in Clojure/Script (not the same syntax as hiccup)
 4. Working with re-frame (so we understand the interaction paradigms; they're different from what you'd be used to in a jsp)
 5. Accessing the InterMine API from functions
 6. Building minified / prod-ready versions of our tool.
