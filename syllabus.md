 1. Downloading and running a Clojure project via [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/).
 2. [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) (clojure's version of HTML)
 3. Writing a [function in Clojure/Script](https://clojure.org/guides/learn/functions) (not the same syntax as hiccup)
 4. Working with [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) (so we understand the interaction paradigms; they're different from what you'd be used to in a jsp)
     1. App DB
     2. Event handlers and subscriptions.
 5. Accessing the InterMine API from functions (via [imcljs](https://github.com/intermine/imcljs))
 6. Building minified / prod-ready versions of our tool.
