 1. Downloading and running a Clojure project via [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/).
 2. [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) (Clojure's version of HTML)
 3. Writing a [function in Clojure/Script](https://clojure.org/guides/learn/functions) (not the same syntax as hiccup)
 4. Working with [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) (so we understand the interaction paradigms; they're different from what you'd be used to in a jsp)
     1. [App DB](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame/blob/master/docs/ApplicationState.md) - where everything you know is stored.
     2. Events, effects, and subscriptions. Start by reviewing [the re-frame code walkthrough](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame/blob/master/docs/CodeWalkthrough.md)
 5. Accessing the InterMine API from functions (via [imcljs](https://github.com/intermine/imcljs))
 6. Building minified / prod-ready versions of our tool.
