1. [Requirements](requirements.md)
2. [Intro to Clojure](activities/intro-to-clojure.md)
3. [Re-frame and reagent](activities/re-frame-and-reagent.md)

 4. Working with [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) (so we understand the interaction paradigms; they're different from what you'd be used to in a jsp)
     1. [App DB](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame/blob/master/docs/ApplicationState.md) - where everything you know is stored.
     2. Events, effects, and subscriptions. Start by reviewing [the re-frame code walkthrough](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame/blob/master/docs/CodeWalkthrough.md)
 5. Accessing the InterMine API from functions (via [imcljs](https://github.com/intermine/imcljs))
 6. Building minified / prod-ready versions of our tool.
