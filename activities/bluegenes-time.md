Ok, maybe it's time to head over to [BlueGenes](https://github.com/intermine/bluegenes/tree/dev/src/cljs/bluegenes/sections/reportpage/components)

1. Try to follow the readme and get a BlueGenes up and running locally. 
    - can you change the port the bluegenes is running on?
    - set a default mine? 
    - make a change to a stylesheet? Perhaps set the default highlight colour to your favourite colour, and see it working in bluegenes.
2. Still feeling brave and awake, hmmm? Maybe look at the list of [small bugs](https://github.com/yochannah/clojure-bootcamp/blob/master/activities/bugs-to-squash.md) to fix
3. Until now we've mostly focused on ClojureScript. If you look about, can you find where the clojure that runs server-side is living?
