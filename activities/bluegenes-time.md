Ok, maybe it's time to head over to [BlueGenes](https://github.com/intermine/bluegenes/)

1. Try to follow the readme and docs in the `/docs` folder and get a BlueGenes up and running locally. 
    - can you change the port the bluegenes is running on?
    - set a default mine? 
    - make a change to a stylesheet? Perhaps set the default [highlight colour](https://github.com/intermine/bluegenes/blob/dev/less/variables.less#L4) to your favourite colour, and see it working in bluegenes. 
         - If you've never worked with less before, take a quick read about it at [lesscss.org](http://lesscss.org)
2. Still feeling brave and awake, hmmm? Maybe look at the list of [small bugs](https://github.com/yochannah/clojure-bootcamp/blob/master/activities/bugs-to-squash.md) to fix
3. Until now we've mostly focused on ClojureScript. If you look about, can you find where the clojure that runs server-side is living? 

If you're an InterMine core team member, register for [Clojars](https://clojars.org/) and ask Yo to add you as an organisation admin.
